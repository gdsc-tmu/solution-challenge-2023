# Solution-challenge-2023 cafe labo

## Overview

An application that solves problems (food loss, crowding, etc.)  in cafeterias.

## Abstract

Cafeterias are suffering from food loss and crowding. To solve these problems, we introduce a program that uses image recognition to determine the number of people to know how crowded it is.
It is expected to reduce food loss by avoiding congestion and unnecessary waiting time and identifying the proper amount of food to be served to customers.
